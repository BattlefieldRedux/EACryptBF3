Just a little toy for encrypting/decrypting Battlefield 3 Alpha2/Beta data files.

Made this for a friend, algorithm provided by Rick of http://blog.gib.me/

It's very hacky, but I apologise for nothing. It allows you to decrypt a file, edit it, and re-encrypt it.

The usage tells you how to re-encrypt, and decrypt respectively (which is likely the reverse order to how you'd go about it.)


```
Usage: EACryptrBF3.exe e <encrypted_file> <decrypted_file> <output_file>
       EACryptrBF3.exe d <encrypted_file> <decrpyted_file>
```
